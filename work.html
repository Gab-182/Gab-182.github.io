												<h2>My work experience explained as</h2>
												<p>The Journey of Growth and Learning</p>
											</header>

											<p>I embarked on my professional journey as an agriculture engineer in Beirut, Lebanon, dedicating almost four years to working
												with a reputable company that provided vital plant pesticide protection to local farmers. This experience allowed me to
												understand the importance of leveraging technology to enhance efficiency and productivity. <br>
												<br>
												Driven by a passion for programming and software development, I transitioned into the world of technology. As a freelancer,
												I collaborated with a civil engineering company, where I developed a program using Python ,tkinter and other python
												libraries. This software simplified the calculation of building base dimensions, empowering engineers with a
												user-friendly tool.<br>
												<br>
												My journey in technology continued to unfold as I delved into web development. Equipped with a solid foundation in HTML,
												CSS, and JavaScript, I took on freelance projects as a front-end web developer, crafting visually appealing and functional
												websites for clients in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.<br>
												<br>
												The ever-evolving landscape of technology led me to explore the exciting realm of blockchain. Eager to embrace this
												cutting-edge technology, I joined a boot camp focused on Solana blockchain. This immersive experience equipped me with
												the skills to create a platform within the Solana ecosystem, facilitating seamless and secure donation campaigns for
												various entities.<br>
												<br>
												Currently, my passion lies in the realm of machine learning algorithms, AI, and data science. With a thirst for knowledge,
												I am actively pursuing courses to expand my expertise in these areas. My ultimate aspiration is to channel my skills and
												passion into a role that allows me to contribute to the field of AI and data science, making a meaningful impact with my
												work.<br>
												As I continue to grow and evolve, I eagerly anticipate the next chapter of my career, where I can apply my diverse skill 
												set and drive innovation in the field of machine learning and AI.</p>
