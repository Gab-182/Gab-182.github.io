												<h2>Proud Moments and Meaningful Reflections in My Career</h2>
												<p>That Shaped My Journey</p>
											</header>

											<p>In my pursuit of knowledge and passion for AI, machine learning, and data science, I have undertaken multiple courses to enhance my skills. One standout experience 
												was participating in the prestigious healathon, where I had the opportunity to attend a rigorous one-month bootcamp. 
												As part of a talented team, we developed a cutting-edge machine learning model focused on predicting chronic kidney diseases. 
												Additionally, we created a user-friendly demo web application to facilitate seamless interaction between doctors and patients. 
												Our outstanding efforts and innovative solution earned us the first-place position globally in the hackathon, and our success was celebrated in various national newspapers. 
												Alongside my involvement in the healathon, I have actively participated in competitions and coding challenges organized by 42 Abu Dhabi, including web development 
												competitions and a thrilling cybersecurity competition hosted by Bacon Red. These experiences have further honed my skills and allowed me to showcase my abilities in diverse fields. 
												Collectively, these achievements have fueled my ambition to continuously excel and contribute to the dynamic world of AI and data science.</p>
